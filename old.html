<center><h1>How to <em>NOT</em> suck at Spy</h1>
<p>First of all, you need to (obviously) look like a legitamite team member. Here are some dead giveaways that you're a spy:</p>
<li>
<ul>You changed disguises/cloaked in front of the opposing team</ul>
<ul>You used your sapper in front of the other team</ul>
<ul>You picked Scout (spy scouts move a lot slower than real scouts)</ul>
  <ul>Don't go around stalking one person you're trying to backstab</ul>
<li>
In addition, here are some things that are a possible giveaway
<li>
<ul>You're with your own team a lot.</ul>
<ul>Even worse if you don't try to harm them.</ul>
<ul>You sapped something around the corner and then showed up</ul>
<ul>What you're doing seems out of place for the class you're disguised as (e.g. why would a Scout head for your own intel)</ul>
</li>
<p>Well, that's what to NOT do, but what SHOULD you do?</p>
<li>
<ul>Well, keep in mind that your name has changed to a fake name. Avoid being around the person you're disguised as</ul>
<ul>If you want to sap something, wait for the engineer to leave. You can't sap while invisible and sapping right in front of them will result in death</ul>
<ul>Try to mimic the goal of the class you choose. I peronsally pick Engineer as they have good reason to head for the intel</ul>
<ul>Only backstab if you're right behind them and you're confident.</ul>
<ul>Don't use the cloak on top of dispenser trick, because they can see you by touching the dispenser</ul>
</li>
<p>That's all for now, but let me know on <a href="http://steamcommunity.com/id/Nalexa-1124">Steam</a> if you have something to contribute :)</p>
